# Car_value_prediction
This is a Machine learning model based on Capstone project to predict the price of the car based on various aspects of the car. Example  Transmission,Build year,etc
Data Science project which performs EDA & Build the Machine Learning Model.


Then performed the data preprocessing & cleaning.
I have done Exploratarty Data Analaysis ( EDA) using graphical libraries like matplotlib, Seaborn.
We have created the ML model to predict the car's selling price based on the other features.
Tried the various regression model & chose the best model among them & saved it using the pickle library.
Created the streamlit app & deployed the ML model onto it.
Below are the details of the file:-

CAR DETAILS.csv --> Contains the dataset
Data_preprocessing_Cleaning_Mlmodel --> Creation of the ML Model
EDA_Graphical_Analysis --> EDA
app.py --> Streamlit app
best_model.pkl --> Saved ML Model
Project PPT --> Detailed presentation onto the project
